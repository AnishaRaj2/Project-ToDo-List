# Project-ToDo-List

I made a Todo List to practice ReactJS. This is my first project using React.

As a user, I can

    read a list of tasks.
    add a task using the mouse or keyboard.
    mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard.
    delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
    edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
