# Project-ToDo-List

I made this simple responsive Todo-List app to practice ReactJS. This is my first project using React.

I used **ReactJS**, **React Hooks (useState & useEffect)** and created to-dos are saved in the browser using **LocalStorage** and can be reused after reopening the browser tab.

As a user, I can
   + read a list of tasks.
   + add a task using the mouse or keyboard.
   + mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard.
   + delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
